          Hi, I'm Sarah

        <p className="mt-4 font-serif text-3xl leading-[1.15] tracking-[-0.5px] text-gray-500 md:text-4xl">
          I am an experienced trainer, coach and product expert with a track
          record of building and managing successful products and teams.

          I have a unique ability to analyze and empathize with a given
          challenge or situation extremely fast. Developing a vision how to
          tackle it and then executing the strategy to get there reliably and
          successfully, was my bread and butter for 10 years. Most important for
          me: while moving forward making sure everyone is on board, aligned and
          motivated - leveraging everyone's strengths.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-6 text-xl text-gray-600">
          People know me for my structured and solution-focused way of working.
          Simultaneously, they value me for my ability to make people feel
          included, heard and seen. My workshops and facilitations have proven
          to bring clarity, alignment and focus - while also being enjoyable.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-6 text-xl text-gray-600">
          In my career in a double-digit growing, listed company I learned the
          importance of working efficiently and effectively to find solutions,
          focus on customers, and create value. I am always seeking ways to
          improve processes and people and make the most of every interaction.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-6 text-xl text-gray-600">
          I enjoy facing new situations and challenges and tailoring solutions
          that simply work. And now I'm curious how I could support you.
